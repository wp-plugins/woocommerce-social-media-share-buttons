= Have questions about Woocommerce Social Media Share Buttons Plugin?
=

 Send us an email to toastiestudio@gmail.com and we will try to answer them.

= Will you be adding Instragram to the plugin?
= I will not be adding a Instragram share button to the plugin. Instagram does not actually support image sharing the same as facebook, pinterest etc. do.
The only way to post a picture to Instagram is by uploading it yourself as Instagram specifically don't want users posting/sharing other peoples photos on its platform.
